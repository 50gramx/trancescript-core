# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming community.

- Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive
- Assume good intent; focus on solutions
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Use clear, professional language in issues/PRs

Incident reporting: Email the maintainers or open a confidential security issue (see SECURITY.md). Maintainers will review, take appropriate action, and may restrict access for repeated violations.

This policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant and common OSS guidelines.
